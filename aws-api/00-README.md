Before you can run this script:
AWS CLI must be installed
AWS CLI must be configured
The profile you use must have the necessary permisions to perform the operations in the script.

NOTE: The scripting language of my choice is bash shell scripting. But coming from an IT operations background, I have provided a possible solution to this task from a devop engineer's perspective. A developers' solution may be more sophiscated and complete given their advanced/expert competency is various scriping/programming language.
